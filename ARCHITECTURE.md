## Technical Stack

### Backend Technologies
```python
# Core service stack
- FastAPI (async, high-performance)
- Azure SDK for Python
- SQLAlchemy (database ORM)
- Redis (caching and sessions)
- WebSocket (real-time audio streaming)
- Pydantic (data validation)
```

### Infrastructure
```yaml
# Azure-native deployment
- Azure Container Apps (serverless containers)
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL (EU-region)
- Azure Redis Cache (EU-region)
- Azure Speech Services (EU-region)
- Azure OpenAI (EU-region)
- Azure Communication Services
```

### Security & Privacy

#### GDPR Requirements
```python
# Data processing compliance
- All data within EU region
- Data minimization principles
- Retention policies (30 days for recordings)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Consent management system
- Right to erasure implementation
```

#### Security Measures
```python
# Multi-layer security
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- AES-256 encryption for data storage
- Azure AD authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key rotation
- Comprehensive audit logging
```

## Call Flow Architecture

### Call Lifecycle
```python
1. Incoming call → Azure Communication Services
2. Call answered → Call Automation API webhook
3. Audio streaming → Speech Services (STT)
4. Text processing → Voice Agent Service
5. LLM response → Azure OpenAI
6. Response generation → Speech Services (TTS)
7. Audio playback → Azure Communication Services
8. Call completion → Data persistence
```

### Dialog State Management
```python
# State machine for appointment booking
States:
- CALL_INITIATED
- GREETING_COMPLETE
- APPOINTMENT_TYPE_COLLECTED
- TIME_PREFERENCE_COLLECTED
- AVAILABLE_SLOTS_PRESENTED
- PATIENT_NAME_COLLECTED
- BOOKING_CONFIRMED
- CALL_COMPLETED
```

## Performance & Scalability

### Response Time Optimization
```python
# Target: <1.6s average response time
- Streaming STT: 200ms
- LLM response: 800ms
- TTS generation: 400ms
- Network latency: 200ms
```

### Scalability Design
```python
# Supporting 100 concurrent calls
- Azure Container Apps auto-scaling
- Azure Redis cluster for session management
- PostgreSQL read replicas
- CDN for static audio assets
```

## Azure Communication Services Integration

### Call Automation Features
```python
# Leveraging Azure's voice agent capabilities
- Programmable call control
- Real-time media streaming
- DTMF handling
- Call recording (GDPR compliant)
- Advanced call routing
```

### Cost Optimization
```python
# Azure ecosystem pricing benefits
- Reduced data egress costs
- Bundled service discounts
- Pay-per-use model
- Regional pricing optimization
```

## Data Utilization

### Analytics (Optional)
```python
# Privacy-preserving insights
- Call duration patterns
- Common appointment types
- System performance metrics
- User satisfaction scores
```

### Model Improvement
```python
# Continuous learning
- Anonymized conversation analysis
- A/B testing for dialog variations
- Finnish language model fine-tuning
- Performance optimization
```

## Reliability & Disaster Recovery

### Fault Tolerance
```python
# Recovery strategies
